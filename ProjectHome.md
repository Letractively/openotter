**_SECURITY ALERT:_ OpenOtter is not a secure piece of software. There is currently a security hole allowing arbitrary commands to be executed on whatever server it is being run on. As such, its use should be discontinued. Given that I no longer have the necessary software to develop this server, there are no plans in the works to fix this issue.**

OpenOtter is no longer in development. It is kept here solely for archival purposes.

OpenOtter is a web server that lets you embed Python into any page. It also lets you have Python scripts and shell scripts as pages. It can be placed in any folder, and it only requires that you have Python, any version in your path, as well as having the sh shell script interpreter in your path. OpenOtter is made in REALbasic.


OpenOtter v.2.0 is released.
An update to the database console GUI is released, version 2.1.
